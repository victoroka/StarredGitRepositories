## Libraries
The project was built with the Apple's brand new framework **SwiftUI**, a **native** user interface toolkit that lets us design apps in a declarative way. And for testing, it was used the following third-party dependencies managed by **CocoaPods**:
- **Quick**: The Swift (and Objective-C) testing framework, mainly used for BDD (behavior-driven development) tests.
- **Nimble**: A Matcher Framework for Swift and Objective-C that allows you to express expectations using a natural, easily understood language.
